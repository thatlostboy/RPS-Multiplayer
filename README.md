# RPS-Multiplayer

My attempt at doing the RPS multipler

I believe I have most of th features in there. 

1) only two players can play and trash talk with each other
2) remainder can observer the game and trash talk in real time.   
3) when a player leaves, a slot becomes open and anyone can join (this ues firebabse ondisconnect method)
4) to leave, just refresh or close your browser
